        <p>Hello! My name is Sophie Archibald, and I am from Centerville, Utah. I served my mission in Arcadia, CA, I got back in March, then I worked at a chocolate factory over the summer! </p>
        <p>I am a Software Engineering major, and I am super excited to learn how to build websites in this class. I have a little bit of experience with HTML and Javascript, but I haven't really worked with CSS before. I'm really looking forward to using it in this class to design websites.</p>
